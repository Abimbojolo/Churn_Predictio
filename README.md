# APPLICATION OF CHURN PREDICTION TO IMPROVE RETENTION OF CUSTOMER IN GROCERY ONLINE SHOPPING

The evolving nature of e-commerce today has necessitated grocery retailers to keep existing customers even while sourcing for new ones (Patil et al., 2017), and because groceries are so essential to daily living, the grocery industry is expanding significantly. Consumers not just have multiple options of retail outlets or stores, they also have an array of products as options to choose from (Tandon, 2012). This study will explore the various ways in which churn prediction can improve and enhance Customer Retention in grocery e-retailing.

## Business Problem

Customer Churn is a significant challenge for companies trying to keep a loyal customer base in the highly competitive online grocery retail market. Churn, or the loss of buyers to other businesses, can result in a loss of income and impede corporate expansion. As a result, to reduce churn rates and boost retention of customers in the grocery e-retailing industry, it is necessary to employ focused retention strategies.
This characterization of the problem emphasises the significance of resolving customer loss in grocery commerce and stresses the requirement for precise churn prediction and successful retention methods. The long-term economic success and sustainability of grocery e-retail enterprises are acknowledged to depend on decreasing churn rates and raising retention of customers. 
 
## Data
The E-commerce Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction dataset was obtained online from Ankit Verma (2021), Product at Ufaber Edutech Pvt Ltd with the permission of Kaggle. 


## Methods

Python programming was used to investigate this dataset, and Power BI was utilised to explore relationships between variables through visualisations.
Python is a great option for managing big amounts of data, according to Wu et al., (2017), because of its scalability, aptitude for distributed computing, and support for simultaneous processing. As Brownlee underlines, Python is frequently used for Machine Learning tasks due to its simplicity, readability, and strong development community. 

It offers an extensive collection of machine learning libraries and tools, such TensorFlow and PyTorch, that make it easier to apply complicated algorithms effectively. Hence, Python is the best option for handling the big datasets that are frequently used in Machine Learning (ML) applications. 
The Figure below illustrates the various EDA Procedures, Data pre-processing and Machine Learning MModels used in the study.

#### Personalisation and Retention Strategies

- Personalized Voice Shopping
- Customized social commerce
- Emotional Personalization
- Personalisation of Gifts
- Experience Personalised AR/VR Shopping
- Loyalty Programmes 

## Recommendations


By offering insightful details on the use of churn prediction to improve customer retention in grocery e-retailing, this thesis has made a significant academic advancement in the fields of Data Science, Analytics, and Technologies.
Instead of taking a generic approach to consumer retention, businesses should increase customer retention by implementing sophisticated personalization and customization tactics that are specific to their needs and preferences.
The study also suggests a methodical framework for grocery retailers looking to improve customer retention and guarantee customers are kept and retained. The framework, which offers a workable solution, relies on data-driven technical insights leading to proactive strategies that would help the corporate growth of the grocery e-retail business.

## Considerations for Future Studies

The following will be taken into account in further efforts and additional research
- A more accurate dataset from larger businesses affected by consumer attrition
- Deep Learning and Machine Learning models that are more advanced and contemporary.
- The inclusion of new features that will improve model training, such as recognising business rivals that clients patronise and periodic components like holidays 
- The stage 3 of the framework's proposed techniques' applicability and performance
